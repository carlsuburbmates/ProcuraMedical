---

## VETTING CRITERIA (Use to Evaluate Each Supplier)

### 1. DROPSHIPPING CAPABILITY
**Questions to ask:**
- "Do you offer dropshipping services to participants' home addresses?"
- "Can you ship directly to the end-user without involving our company?"
- "What is your shipping SLA (Service Level Agreement)?"
- "Do you include your invoice in the box, or ship blind?"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Supplier requires all orders ship to reseller address first
- ❌ Supplier includes their invoice (compromises blind shipping requirement)
- ❌ No documented SLA or vague shipping timelines

---

### 2. NDIS CODE ALIGNMENT
**Questions to ask:**
- "What NDIS support codes do your products cover?"
- "Can you provide a product list with official NDIS codes?"
- "Are your prices at or below NDIS maximum funding limits for these items?"
- "Do you have a pricelist specific to NDIS participants?"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Supplier unclear about NDIS codes or doesn't have official mapping
- ❌ Prices exceed NDIS funding limits (you won't be able to bill)
- ❌ No NDIS-specific pricing tier

---

### 3. PRICING & MARGIN VIABILITY
**Requirements:**
- Supplier's wholesale price ≤ 70% of NDIS maximum price (leaves 30% margin minimum)
- Example: If NDIS max = $1,200, supplier wholesale should be ≤$840
- Margin needed to cover: Your time + website + payments processing + insurance + profit

**Questions to ask:**
- "What is your wholesale discount vs. retail price?"
- "Do you offer volume discounts (1–10 units, 10–50 units, 50+ units)?"
- "What is your minimum order quantity (MOQ)?"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Wholesale price > 70% of NDIS max
- ❌ No volume discount structure
- ❌ High MOQ that limits flexibility

---

### 4. INVENTORY & STOCK STATUS
**Questions to ask:**
- "Which products are in-stock and ready to ship immediately?"
- "Which products have lead times, and how long?"
- "Can you accommodate varying order volumes (1–50 units/week growing to 100+)?"
- "Do you have capacity to scale with our growth?"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Most products on backorder (delays fulfillment)
- ❌ Supplier unwilling to commit to scaling with you
- ❌ Long lead times (>10 business days) for core products

---

### 5. RETURNS, DEFECTS & COMPLIANCE
**Questions to ask:**
- "What is your defects/returns policy?"
- "How do we handle damaged goods shipped to the participant?"
- "Who handles the claim/replacement?"
- "Do you accept returns if the participant changes their mind?"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ No returns policy
- ❌ Participant bears all risk (bad for reputation)
- ❌ Unclear escalation path for defects

---

### 6. COMMUNICATION & RESPONSIVENESS
**Assessment criteria:**
- How quickly did they respond to your inquiry? (Target: <24 hours)
- Are they professional + clear in communication?
- Do they have a dedicated account manager (vs. generic support)?
- Are they willing to support an NDIS-compliant business model?

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Slow response times (>3 days)
- ❌ Unclear about their processes
- ❌ Dismissive of NDIS-specific requirements

---

## RESEARCH & VETTING PROCESS

### STEP 1: Initial Applications (Jan 20–24)
**For each supplier, research + apply:**
1. Visit website; note account signup process
2. Research company: Years in business, reviews, NDIS experience
3. Complete online application OR call account manager
4. Key info to gather:
   - Application deadline (if any)
   - Account approval timeline
   - Initial product list + NDIS codes (if available online)
   - Contact person name + direct phone
5. Document response time + initial feedback

**Deliverable:** Spreadsheet with application dates + response dates for each supplier

---

### STEP 2: Follow-Up Calls (Jan 27–31)
**For suppliers who approved or are pending:**
1. Call/email account manager
2. Request detailed conversation about:
   - Dropshipping process (walk through end-to-end)
   - NDIS codes + pricing specifics
   - Blind shipping confirmation
   - Wholesale pricing (with volume tiers)
   - Minimum order quantities
   - Delivery SLA
   - Defects/returns policy
3. Ask: "Can you provide a written Service Level Agreement (SLA)?"
4. Request: Full product catalog with NDIS codes

**Deliverable:** Notes from each call + SLA agreements received

---

### STEP 3: Pricing Analysis (Feb 3–7)
**For approved suppliers:**
1. Create pricing spreadsheet:
   - Product name | NDIS code | NDIS max price | Supplier wholesale | Your margin % | Margin $ (per unit)
2. Verify margin calculation:
   - Margin $ = (NDIS max price – Supplier cost) – (Website overhead ÷ orders/month)
   - Target: Minimum $600 net profit per order
3. Flag: Any products where margin is <$200 (too tight; consider dropping)
4. Identify: Top 20 products with >$800 margin (your "heroes")

**Deliverable:** Pricing analysis spreadsheet with margin calculations

---

### STEP 4: Blind Shipping Verification (Feb 7–11)
**For approved suppliers:**
1. Place 2–3 test orders (fake participant addresses, but real ones)
2. Verify at delivery:
   - [ ] Only YOUR invoice in box
   - [ ] Supplier invoice NOT included
   - [ ] Product matches description
   - [ ] Packaging professional (good for brand)
   - [ ] Delivery timeline met
3. Document any issues

**Deliverable:** Test order verification report (photos of packaging + contents recommended)

---

### STEP 5: Contract/SLA Review (Feb 11 Pre-Launch)
**For all approved suppliers:**
1. Review any SLA agreements provided
2. Extract key terms:
   - Shipping address policy (blind shipping requirement)
   - Delivery SLA (e.g., 5–7 business days)
   - Returns/defects policy
   - Pricing locks (how often prices updated?)
   - Contact escalation path
   - Notice period for changes to terms
3. Create "Supplier Operating Manual" for reference during orders
4. Store all SLAs in shared folder (Google Drive)

**Deliverable:** Supplier Operating Manual + SLAs folder

---

## NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### For Pricing
**Approach:**
- Start with: "We expect to place 100–200 orders/month within 6 months"
- Ask: "What wholesale discount can you offer for this volume?"
- Leverage: Multi-supplier strategy (they know you have alternatives)
- Goal: Lock in 35–40% discount (vs. NDIS max)

**Negotiation points:**
- ✅ Volume commitment (if feasible; but be conservative)
- ✅ Payment terms (e.g., "We pay within 3 days of order")
- ✅ Consistency (prices don't change month-to-month)

---

### For Shipping/Delivery
**Approach:**
- "We need reliable 5–7 day delivery to participant addresses"
- "We're NDIS-specific, so participant satisfaction is critical"
- Ask: "Can you guarantee delivery within 7 days? If not, what's the SLA?"

**Negotiation points:**
- ✅ Documented SLA (so you have recourse if late)
- ✅ Blind shipping (must confirm in writing)
- ✅ Escalation process (if order delayed)

---

### For NDIS Compliance
**Approach:**
- "We're planning to register as an NDIS provider. We need products that align with NDIS funding limits"
- "Can you help us map your products to official NDIS support codes?"
- Ask: "Do you have experience with other NDIS providers? How do they price?"

**Negotiation points:**
- ✅ NDIS code mapping (they provide, not you)
- ✅ Pricing transparency (no hidden fees/markups)
- ✅ Documentation (for audit purposes)
