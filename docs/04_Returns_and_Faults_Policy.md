## 1) Your rights (Australian Consumer Law)

Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. ([accc.gov.au](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/buying-products-and-services/warranties?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Warranties apply in addition to ACL rights. ([accc.gov.au](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/buying-products-and-services/warranties?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## 2) Change-of-mind returns (tight, but lawful)

The rules in this section apply only to change-of-mind situations and do not limit your rights if there is a problem with the product under the Australian Consumer Law. ([accc.gov.au](https://www.accc.gov.au/business/problem-with-a-product-or-service-you-sold/repair-replace-refund-cancel?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 2.1 Hygiene and personal-care items

For hygiene essentials and personal-care items:

- Change-of-mind returns are generally not accepted once packaging is opened or where the item is not suitable for resale due to health/safety reasons.
- If the item is unopened, unused, and in original sealed packaging, a change-of-mind return may be considered case-by-case.

### 2.2 Other assistive products

For non-hygiene items, change-of-mind returns may be considered only if:

- unused and in resale condition, and
- all packaging/accessories/manuals included, and
- requested promptly after delivery.

### 2.3 Fees and shipping (change-of-mind only)

For approved change-of-mind returns, return shipping is the customer's responsibility.

Any inspection/processing approach applies only to change-of-mind returns, never to ACL remedies.

## 3) Faults, defects, wrong items (ACL remedies)

If an item is faulty, damaged on arrival, or not what you ordered:

- contact us with order details and photos where relevant,
- we may assess and coordinate repair, replacement, or refund depending on the issue. ([accc.gov.au](https://www.accc.gov.au/business/problem-with-a-product-or-service-you-sold/repair-replace-refund-cancel?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## 4) Manufacturer warranties

Manufacturer warranties may apply in addition to ACL rights; they do not replace them. ([accc.gov.au](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/buying-products-and-services/warranties?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
