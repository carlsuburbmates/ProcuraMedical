✅ **Scalability:** Procedures support 15–40 orders/week (Phase 0) → 40–80+ (post-registration)
✅ **Supplier reliability:** Vetting framework ensures blind shipping, SLA, NDIS codes, margin viability
✅ **Customer clarity:** Public policies transparent about Phase 0 constraints + future capabilities

## FAQ

**Q: Can I modify these documents?**

A: Yes. All documents v1.1 are baseline templates. Customize:
- Contact details (email, phone, website)
- Payment bank details (doc 22–23)
- Supplier names in registers
- Timeline expectations (based on test orders)

Do NOT:
- Remove ACL disclaimers (legal requirement)
- Mislead about consumer rights
- Hide supplier documentation requirements
- Omit register/log fields (audit trail essential)

---

**Q: What if a supplier refuses blind shipping?**

A: Mark **Tier 2/3 pending → Declined** in Supplier_Tracker (doc 16). Move to next supplier.
Blind shipping is non-negotiable for customer brand protection.

---

**Q: When do I transition to Phase 1 (registered)?**

A: Once NDIS registration granted (planned May 2026):
1. Update Operating_Rules (doc 01) with registration statement
2. Expand Supplier_Tracker (doc 16) to include Tier 3 (mid-cost/complex)
3. Update Terms (doc 06) + invoice templates (docs 22–23) with GST treatment
4. Expand SKU_Shortlist (doc 17) to higher price points
5. Keep all Phase 0 procedures intact (they scale)

---

**Q: Who should see the internal policies?**

A: Keep internal (docs 07–12, 13–17) in private folder:
- For audit/compliance review (show evidence + registers if questioned)
- For operational staff (procedures 07–12)
- NOT for public (no customer benefit; creates liability risk)

Keep public (docs 01–06) on website/shareable.

---

## Support & Verification

**Before going live, verify:**

1. ✅ ABN correct + publicly listed
2. ✅ Contact email/phone current
3. ✅ Bank details correct in invoices (docs 22–23)
4. ✅ Supplier evidence folders accessible
5. ✅ Registers ready to populate
6. ✅ Test orders placed + blind shipping confirmed
7. ✅ Invoice templates (.docx/.pdf) tested with sample data

---

## Integrity Statement

**Sources:**

- **ACCC (Australian Competition & Consumer Commission):** Consumer Law, warranties, remedies, returns guidance
- **OAIC (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner):** Australian Privacy Principles
- **Project requirements:** Supplier vetting framework, registers/logs, audit trail, NDIS compliance
- **Industry practice:** Dropshipping, blind shipping, SLA documentation, margining

**Known constraints (Phase 0):**

- ✅ Unregistered (GST not applicable)
- ✅ Self-managed + plan-managed only (no NDIA-managed)
- ✅ Supplier-dependent for blind shipping (not all suppliers support)
- ✅ Delivery timelines softened until test data (3–7 days assumed)
- ✅ Returns restricted (hygiene items non-returnable if opened)

**Failsafe mechanisms:**

- ✅ Monthly register review → identify patterns
- ✅ Incident escalation → flag safety concerns
- ✅ Complaint management → ACL remedies always available
- ✅ Supplier performance tracking → suspend/replace underperformers
