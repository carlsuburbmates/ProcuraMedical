## Call Script

**Opening:**

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Procura Medical. We've submitted a trade account application and wanted to confirm a few key details about your dropshipping services. Do you have 5 minutes?"

---

### Key Questions (in order):

1. **"Do you support dropshipping direct to end customers?"**
   - *Listen for:* Clear yes/no; any restrictions
   - *Note in tracker:* Y / N

2. **"Can you blind ship — meaning no supplier invoice or supplier-branded documentation in the box?"**
   - *Listen for:* Clarity on their process; are they willing?
   - *Note in tracker:* Y / N / "Will confirm in writing"

3. **"What are dispatch lead times and delivery expectations? Can you confirm in writing?"**
   - *Listen for:* Standard turnaround (3–7 days typical); willingness to document
   - *Note in tracker:* Timeline + Y/N for written SLA

4. **"What is your returns/defects/DOA process? Who covers freight for faults?"**
   - *Listen for:* Clear process; responsibility for defects; return freight
   - *Note in tracker:* Y / N for written policy

5. **"Do you provide a wholesale price list (with version/date) and NDIS code mapping?"**
   - *Listen for:* Availability; format; whether NDIS codes are mapped
   - *Note in tracker:* Y / N / "Will send"

6. **"Who is our account contact and escalation point?"**
   - *Listen for:* Name, direct phone, email
   - *Note in tracker:* Contact name + phone + email

---

### Closing:

"Thank you for confirming those details. We're expecting to place [1–20] orders per week starting Feb 11. Can you support that volume?"

*Listen for:* Confidence in scaling; any concerns

"We'll send over a formal SLA request once we have our catalogue finalized. Looking forward to working together."

---

## Post-Call Actions

1. **Update Supplier_Tracker.md** with responses
2. **Send SLA Request Sheet** (doc 21) via email with requested details listed
3. **Create supplier folder** in evidence storage with call notes + any documents received
4. **Set follow-up reminder** for 5 business days (if SLA not yet received)

---

## Red Flags to Document

- Hesitancy about blind shipping
- No clear SLA or refusal to commit in writing
- Unwilling to scale volume
- No NDIS code mapping available
- Slow response times

*If multiple red flags:* Update **Supplier_Tracker.md** status to **Pending** or **Declined** and move to next supplier.
