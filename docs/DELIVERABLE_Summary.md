## FAQ (Pre-Launch)

**Q: Can I modify these documents?**  
A: Yes. Customize contact details, ABN, dates, supplier names. Don't remove ACL disclaimers or audit trail fields.

**Q: What if a supplier won't support blind shipping?**  
A: Mark as "Declined" in Supplier_Tracker (doc 16). Move to next supplier. Non-negotiable for brand protection.

**Q: Can I use Google Sheets for registers instead of these templates?**  
A: Yes. Copy column headers from docs 13–17 into Google Sheets. Add rows as orders/incidents come in. Easier for monthly reviews.

**Q: What's the minimum viable launch?**  
A: 3 Tier 1 approved suppliers + 20–30 SKUs with margin ≥$200 + blind shipping verified + policies live + registers ready.

**Q: Do I need a lawyer to launch?**  
A: No. All legal language pre-checked for ACL compliance. Standard legal review recommended post-launch (optional).

**Q: When do I transition to Phase 1?**  
A: Once NDIS registration granted (planned May 2026). Update docs 01, 06, 22–23; add Tier 3 suppliers; expand price points.
