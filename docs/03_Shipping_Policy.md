## 1) Where we ship

We ship to Australian addresses.

---

## 2) How shipping works

Many items are shipped directly from our supplier network to your nominated address.

---

## 3) Typical timeframes (softened until test data)

Many items arrive within typical carrier timeframes (often around 3–7 business days in metro areas), but timing can vary based on the product, supplier, stock status, and location.

We will communicate any known lead time differences during the order process and/or in your order confirmation.

---

## 4) Tracking

Where tracking is available, we provide tracking details once dispatched.

---

## 5) Delays and what happens next

If your order is delayed, we will provide an update and options that may include waiting, switching to an alternative item (where feasible), or cancellation depending on order status.

Nothing in this policy limits your rights under ACL. ([accc.gov.au](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/buying-products-and-services/warranties?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## 6) Incorrect address / failed delivery

Please ensure delivery details are correct. If an item is returned due to incorrect address or failed delivery, additional shipping fees may apply for re-delivery.

---

## 7) Damage in transit

If an item arrives damaged, contact us as soon as practical so we can coordinate a remedy. This does not limit ACL rights. ([accc.gov.au](https://www.accc.gov.au/business/problem-with-a-product-or-service-you-sold/repair-replace-refund-cancel?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
