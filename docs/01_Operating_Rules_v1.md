## 7) Recordkeeping (Phase 0)

Every order must have:

- an entry in **Order_Log.md**
- supplier documentation stored per **Supplier Tracker / Evidence Pack** requirements
- any incidents recorded in **Incident_Register.md**
- any complaints recorded in **Complaints_Register.md**

## 8) Future registration (explicit)

These operating rules are written to support an unregistered provider model in Phase 0 and can be expanded to cover NDIS-registered operations once registration is granted.

### Post-registration switch (when applicable)

When registered (later phase), update:

- Terms + website statements about registration status
- supplier pack to include any additional documentation requirements
- invoicing templates (GST and "Tax Invoice" treatment if GST-registered)
