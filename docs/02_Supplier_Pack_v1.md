## 3) What we need from you (non-negotiables)

These requirements align to the supplier vetting framework.

### A) Dropshipping + blind shipping

- Ship direct to end customer addresses.
- **Blind shipping:** do not include supplier invoice or supplier-branded documentation in the shipment.
- **Legal clarity (important):** Blind shipping refers only to commercial documentation/branding; it does not remove or change any consumer law obligations that apply to the goods supplied.

### B) Documentation (traceable over time)

Provide (email PDF or portal download):

- Product catalogue
- Wholesale pricing list (with version/date) so changes over time are traceable
- Lead times + shipping methods + tracking approach
- Returns/defects/DOA process
- Named contact (account manager) + escalation path
- If available: product-to-NDIS support code mapping

### C) Service levels

- Documented dispatch lead times and delivery expectations (including exceptions).
- **Target profile (where feasible):** standard 3–7 business days metro, but documented per supplier/SKU.

---

## 4) How we place orders

- Orders are issued per customer order.
- Shipping label should show Procura Medical as retailer/sender where supported.
- Tracking provided promptly after dispatch.

---

## 5) Phase 0 vs Post-registration

### Phase 0 (Unregistered)

- Primary focus: low-cost curated SKUs + reliable supplier execution + auditable paperwork.

### Post-registration (later)

- Catalogue and supplier requirements may expand (higher price points / additional documentation).
