## Emergency Contacts

**If something breaks before launch:**

- **Supplier gives wrong NDIS codes:** Ask supplier to verify with NDIS directly. Document in evidence folder.
- **Customer complains about delay:** Reference SLA from supplier evidence folder (doc 21). Escalate to supplier immediately. Log in Complaints_Register (doc 14).
