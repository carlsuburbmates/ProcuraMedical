      <h2>1. Your rights (Australian Consumer Law)</h2>
      <p>
        Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law.
        Warranties apply in addition to ACL rights.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Change-of-mind returns</h2>
      <p>
        The rules in this section apply only to change-of-mind situations and do not limit your rights if there is a problem with the product under the Australian Consumer Law.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Hygiene and personal-care items</h3>
      <p>For hygiene essentials and personal-care items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change-of-mind returns are generally not accepted once packaging is opened or where the item is not suitable for resale due to health/safety reasons.</li>
        <li>If the item is unopened, unused, and in original sealed packaging, a change-of-mind return may be considered case-by-case.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Other assistive products</h3>
      <p>For non-hygiene items, change-of-mind returns may be considered only if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>unused and in resale condition, and</li>
        <li>all packaging/accessories/manuals included, and</li>
        <li>requested promptly after delivery.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Fees and shipping (change-of-mind only)</h3>
      <p>
        For approved change-of-mind returns, return shipping is the customer's responsibility.
        Any inspection/processing approach applies only to change-of-mind returns, never to ACL remedies.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Faults, defects, wrong items (ACL remedies)</h2>
      <p>If an item is faulty, damaged on arrival, or not what you ordered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>contact us with order details and photos where relevant,</li>
        <li>we may assess and coordinate repair, replacement, or refund depending on the issue.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Manufacturer warranties</h2>
      <p>
        Manufacturer warranties may apply in addition to ACL rights; they do not replace them.
      </p>
