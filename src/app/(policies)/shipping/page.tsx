      <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Version:</strong> v1.1<br/><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-20</p>
      
      <hr className="my-8 border-gray-200" />

      <h2>1. Where we ship</h2>
      <p>We ship to Australian addresses.</p>

      <h2>2. How shipping works</h2>
      <p>Many items are shipped directly from our supplier network to your nominated address.</p>

      <h2>3. Typical timeframes</h2>
      <p>
        Many items arrive within typical carrier timeframes (often around 3–7 business days in metro areas), but timing can vary based on the product, supplier, stock status, and location.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will communicate any known lead time differences during the order process and/or in your order confirmation.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Tracking</h2>
      <p>Where tracking is available, we provide tracking details once dispatched.</p>

      <h2>5. Delays and what happens next</h2>
      <p>
        If your order is delayed, we will provide an update and options that may include waiting, switching to an alternative item (where feasible), or cancellation depending on order status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in this policy limits your rights under ACL.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Incorrect address / failed delivery</h2>
      <p>
        Please ensure delivery details are correct. If an item is returned due to incorrect address or failed delivery, additional shipping fees may apply for re-delivery.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Damage in transit</h2>
      <p>
        If an item arrives damaged, contact us as soon as practical so we can coordinate a remedy. This does not limit ACL rights.
